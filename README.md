# Efficiency-of-methods-of-solving-Rubik-s-cube-implemented-in-R

#file 'functions_for_solving' contains basic functions which allows solving the Rubik's cube with LBL and CFOP methos

#file 'scrambles' contains lists which are adjusted to the from which is readable by Rstudio and it is responsible for scrambling the cube, so that we have something to work on

#file 'optimization' contains functions which are responsible for optimization of the methods that were written in 'functions_for_solving' often in a non efficient way

#file 'testing_and_generating_results' contains basic oeprations which were neccesarry during testing process and generating the results process, but when it was not worth to write them as a fucntions

#Diploma thesis is my thesis in which I have explained and described everything needed in order to use the code in all my files
