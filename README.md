# Efficiency-of-methods-of-solving-Rubik-s-cube-implemented-in-R

#file 'functions_for_solving' contains basic functions which allows solving the Rubik's cube with LBL and CFOP methods

#file 'scrambles' contains lists which are adjusted to the from which is readable by Rstudio and it is responsible for scrambling the cube, so that we have something to work on

#file 'optimization' contains functions which are responsible for optimization of the methods that were written in 'functions_for_solving' often in a non efficient way

#file 'testing_and_generating_results' contains basic operations which were neccesarry during testing process and generating the results process, but when it was not worth to write them as a fucntions

#Thesis concerns efficiency of different methods of solving Rubik's cube and their comparison as well as deriving the formula for the number of possible states of Rubik's cube of any size. I have implemented two methods of solving the cube using R and simulated 6000 records in order to compare their efficiency.
